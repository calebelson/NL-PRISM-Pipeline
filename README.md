# NL-PRISM-Pipeline: Dissertation Research

This repository contains the complete research project for applying formal verification to disaster response planning using large language models.

## Repository Structure

## Overview

The [`src/`](src/) directory contains a pipeline that bridges formal verification and disaster response planning. It uses large language models to convert natural language disaster scenarios into formal PRISM models, verifies optimal strategies, and generates human-readable explanations.

**For detailed documentation, setup instructions, and usage examples, see [src/README.md](src/README.md).**

## Experimental Data

The [`data/`](data/) directory contains experimental runs comparing different LLM approaches (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) used in the dissertation.

## Dissertation

The full dissertation documenting this research is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.
