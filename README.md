# NL-PRISM-Pipeline: Dissertation Research

This repository contains the complete research project for applying formal verification to disaster response planning using large language models (LLM).

## Repository Structure

```
├── data/                 # Experimental results used in evaluation
├── docs/                 # Dissertation PDF
└── src/                  # Pipeline source code and tool documentation
```

## Experimental Data

The [`data/`](data/) directory contains experimental runs comparing different LLM approaches (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and output from the pipeline that are used in the dissertation.

## Dissertation

The full dissertation documenting this research is available in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.

## Pipeline

The [`src/`](src/) directory contains a pipeline that improves the user experience of formal verification in disaster response planning using LLMs. The system converts natural language disaster scenarios into formal PRISM models, verifies optimal strategies, and generates human-readable explanations.

**For detailed documentation, setup instructions, and usage examples, see [src/README.md](src/README.md).**
