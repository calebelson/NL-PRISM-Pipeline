Short answer
1) Yes. Total available = 8 units (a:2, c:4, d:2) > demand 7. Feasible.
2) Best plan (maximize reliability): Have T1 move 1 from a and 2 from d together to g via the safest corridor; have T2 move the 4 from c directly to g; include two targeted contingency legs if one main leg fails. Details below.
3) Optimization is purely for reliability (probabilities shown).
5) Overall probability of success for this plan ≈ 0.290 (29.0%).
6) Step-by-step policy and probability breakdown provided below.

Key route reliabilities (per traversal)
- Red: 0.50
- Yellow: 0.85
- Green: 0.99
- D→E→F→G “green corridor” (two greens + one yellow): p_corr = 0.99×0.99×0.85 = 0.833085
- C↔G single red edge: 0.50 per direction
- A↔D single red edge: 0.50 per direction
- G→D→G round trip (corridor both ways): p_corr^2 = 0.833085^2 = 0.6940306
- G→D→A→D→G to move 1 unit from a (two corridors and two red a–d traversals): p = p_corr^2 × 0.25 = 0.1735077

Why this plan is best for reliability
- You must use at least one red edge to move c’s 4 (best is the direct c–g with p=0.5).
- Moving any d supplies to g should use the green corridor (p=0.8331).
- The risky choke point is a–d (red, p=0.5). If you carry both a-units at once and fail, you lose 2 units and can no longer reach 7. The plan below intentionally carries only 1 unit from a on the first a–d crossing so an early failure does not make the mission impossible, and it keeps the number of risky traversals minimal.

Routing and allocation plan (policy)
Main legs
1) Team 1 (T1) at a:
   - Load 1 unit at a.
   - Move a→d (red, p=0.5).
   - At d, load 2 units (now carrying 3 total).
   - Move d→e→f→g (green, green, yellow; p=0.833085).
   - Probability T1 main leg succeeds: 0.5 × 0.833085 = 0.4165425.
2) Team 2 (T2) at c:
   - Load 4 units at c.
   - Move c→g (red; p=0.5).

Stop conditions and contingencies
A) If both main legs succeed: you have delivered 3 + 4 = 7 (actually 7 exactly if T1 took 1 from a and 2 from d). Stop.

B) If T1 main succeeds but T2 fails: T1 is at g. T1 executes a single round trip g→c→g (two red traversals) to fetch from c. Probability of this salvage = 0.5^2 = 0.25. One round trip delivers up to 4 (≥ the 3 still needed). Stop.

C) If T1 fails on the first edge a→d (early), losing only 1 from a: T2 continues:
   - Deliver c→g (red; p=0.5).
   - Shuttle g→d→g to bring the 2 at d (p = 0.6940306).
   - Then fetch the remaining 1 from a via g→d→a→d→g (p = 0.1735077).
   - All three must succeed to reach 7; if any of these legs fail, it’s no longer possible to reach 7.
   - Note: If T1 fails later (after picking up d’s 2), too many resources are lost and the mission becomes infeasible; abort.

Probability of success
Let:
- p_T1 = 0.4165425 (T1 main success)
- p_T2 = 0.5 (T2 main success)
- p_Csalv = 0.25 (T1’s g↔c salvage)
- p_D2 = 0.6940306 (T2’s g↔d for 2 units)
- p_A1 = 0.1735077 (T2’s g→d→a→d→g for 1 unit)

Success occurs in three disjoint ways:
1) Both main legs succeed: p_T1 × p_T2 = 0.4165425 × 0.5 = 0.2082713
2) T1 main succeeds, T2 main fails, then T1 g↔c salvage succeeds:
   p_T1 × (1 − p_T2) × p_Csalv = 0.4165425 × 0.5 × 0.25 = 0.0520678
3) T1 fails early on a→d (prob 0.5), then T2 completes c→g and both shuttles:
   0.5 × p_T2 × p_D2 × p_A1 = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.6940306 × 0.1735077 = 0.0301049

Total success probability ≈ 0.2082713 + 0.0520678 + 0.0301049 = 0.290444 ≈ 29.0%

Step-by-step execution (concise)
- Step 0: T1 loads 1 at a; T2 loads 4 at c.
- Step 1: T1 goes a→d (red).
   - If T1 fails here: go to Contingency C (T2-only sequence).
- Step 2: T1 loads 2 at d and goes d→e→f→g (green, green, yellow).
   - If T1 fails on this corridor: abort (infeasible).
- Step 3: T2 goes c→g (red).
   - If T2 succeeds: total delivered ≥7; stop.
   - If T2 fails: T1 at g executes g→c→g once (two reds) carrying up to 4; stop.
- Contingency C (if T1 failed on Step 1):
   - T2 goes c→g (red). If fail: abort.
   - T2 goes g→d→g to bring 2 from d (corridor round trip). If fail: abort.
   - T2 goes g→d→a→d→g to bring 1 from a (corridor, red, red, corridor). If fail: abort.
   - Stop.

Notes
- Distances are ignored per the “optimize exclusively for reliability” objective.
- Loads never exceed per-team capacity (T1 carries 3; T2 carries 4).
- This plan minimizes red-edge exposures that can make the mission infeasible and exploits the high-reliability d–e–f–g corridor.
- Splitting c’s load or carrying both a-units together is strictly worse for reliability under these probabilities.
