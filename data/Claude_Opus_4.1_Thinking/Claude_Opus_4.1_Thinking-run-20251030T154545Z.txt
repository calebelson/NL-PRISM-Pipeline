Looking at this logistics problem, I need to analyze the feasibility and find the optimal routing plan.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Available Resources:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources**

**Demand:** Point g needs 7 resources

**Transport Capacity:** Each team can carry 4 resources maximum

**Conclusion:** Since we have 8 resources available and need 7, this is feasible if we can successfully route at least 7 resources to g.

## 2. Path Analysis

Let me identify the best paths from each starting/resource point to g:

**From point a to g:**
- a→d→e→f→g: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.416
- a→b→c→g: 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125

**From point c to g:**
- c→g (direct): 0.5
- c→f→g: 0.5 × 0.85 = 0.425

**From point d to g:**
- d→e→f→g: 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.833

## 3. Optimal Strategy

Since each team can carry maximum 4 resources and we need 7, we **must have both teams succeed** (4 + 4 = 8 ≥ 7).

**Optimal Plan:**
- **Team 1:** Start at a → pick up 2 resources → move to d → pick up 2 more resources (total 4) → follow path d→e→f→g
  - Path probability: 0.5 (a→d) × 0.99 (d→e) × 0.99 (e→f) × 0.85 (f→g) = **0.416**

- **Team 2:** Start at c → pick up 4 resources → move directly to g
  - Path probability: **0.5**

## 4. Why This Plan is Optimal

- T1 takes the path through the green edges (highest reliability) after reaching d
- T2 takes the direct path from c to g (better than c→f→g)
- Both teams carry maximum loads to provide 8 resources (1 extra as buffer)

## 5. Probability of Success

Since both teams must succeed:
**P(success) = 0.416 × 0.5 = 0.208 (20.8%)**

## 6. Step-by-Step Plan Description

**Step 1:** Team 1 at point a loads 2 resources

**Step 2:** Team 2 at point c loads 4 resources

**Step 3:** Team 1 travels from a to d via the red edge (probability 0.5)

**Step 4:** Team 1 loads 2 additional resources at point d (now carrying 4 total)

**Step 5:** Team 1 travels d→e via the green edge (probability 0.99)

**Step 6:** Team 1 continues e→f via the green edge (probability 0.99)

**Step 7:** Team 1 completes journey f→g via the yellow edge (probability 0.85)

**Step 8:** Team 2 travels directly c→g via the red edge (probability 0.5)

**Result:** If both teams succeed, 8 resources are delivered to point g (exceeding the requirement of 7).

The overall success probability of 20.8% is the best achievable given the network constraints and safety probabilities.
