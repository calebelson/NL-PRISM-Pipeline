Looking at this logistics problem, I need to analyze the feasibility and find the optimal routing plan.

## 1. Feasibility Check

**Available resources:** 
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources**

**Required:** 7 resources at point g
**Carrying capacity:** 2 teams × 4 resources = 8 resources maximum per trip

✅ **The demand is feasible** - we have 8 resources available and need 7.

## 2. Route Analysis

Let me identify the safest paths for each team:

**From point a to g:**
- a→d→e→f→g: red(0.5) × green(0.99) × green(0.99) × yellow(0.85) = **0.416**
- a→b→c→g: red(0.5) × red(0.5) × red(0.5) = 0.125

**From point c to g:**
- c→g (direct): red(0.5) = **0.5**
- c→f→g: red(0.5) × yellow(0.85) = 0.425
- c→b→d→e→f→g: red(0.5) × yellow(0.85) × green(0.99) × green(0.99) × yellow(0.85) = 0.354

**From point d to g:**
- d→e→f→g: green(0.99) × green(0.99) × yellow(0.85) = **0.833**

## 3. Optimal Allocation Plan

Since we need 7 resources and each team can carry maximum 4, we need both teams to succeed. The optimal allocation is:

**Team 1 (T1):** 
- Carries 4 resources (2 from a + 2 from d)
- Route: a→d→e→f→g
- Probability: 0.416

**Team 2 (T2):**
- Carries 3 resources from c
- Route: c→g (direct)
- Probability: 0.5

## 4. Why This Plan is Optimal

- T1 leverages the safer green edges (d→e→f) after picking up resources at d
- T2 takes the direct route from c to g, which surprisingly has better reliability (0.5) than the alternative through f (0.425)
- Both teams MUST succeed to deliver the required 7 resources

## 5. Probability of Success

**P(success) = P(T1 succeeds) × P(T2 succeeds) = 0.416 × 0.5 = 0.208**

The probability of successfully delivering 7 resources to point g is **20.8%**

## 6. Step-by-Step Plan

**Step 1:** Team 1 at point a loads 2 resources

**Step 2:** Team 1 travels from a to d via the red edge (distance 5, probability 0.5)

**Step 3:** Team 1 loads 2 additional resources at point d (now carrying 4 total)

**Step 4:** Team 1 travels from d to e via the green edge (distance 2, probability 0.99)

**Step 5:** Team 1 travels from e to f via the green edge (distance 4, probability 0.99)

**Step 6:** Team 1 travels from f to g via the yellow edge (distance 10, probability 0.85), delivering 4 resources

**Step 7:** Simultaneously, Team 2 at point c loads 3 resources

**Step 8:** Team 2 travels directly from c to g via the red edge (distance 6, probability 0.5), delivering 3 resources

**Result:** If both teams succeed, 7 resources are delivered to point g, meeting the exact requirement.
