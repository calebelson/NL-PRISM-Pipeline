Looking at this logistics problem, I'll analyze the feasibility and develop an optimal routing plan.

## 1. Feasibility Check

**Available resources:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources**

**Required:** 7 resources at point g

**Conclusion:** The demand is feasible since 8 ≥ 7 resources.

## 2. Critical Constraint Analysis

With each team able to carry maximum 4 resources and needing 7 total at g, **both teams MUST successfully deliver** for the mission to succeed:
- Maximum single team delivery: 4 resources < 7 required
- Minimum successful configuration: 4 + 3 = 7 resources

## 3. Optimal Routing Plan

After analyzing all possible paths and their probabilities:

### Team 1 (T1) - Starting at point a:
**Mission:** Collect 2 resources from a + 2 resources from d, deliver 4 total to g
**Optimal path:** a → d → e → f → g
- a → d (red): 0.5
- d → e (green): 0.99
- e → f (green): 0.99
- f → g (yellow): 0.85
- **Total probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4166**

### Team 2 (T2) - Starting at point c:
**Mission:** Collect 4 resources from c, deliver to g
**Optimal path:** c → g (direct)
- c → g (red): 0.5
- **Total probability: 0.5**

Alternative paths for T2 (c→f→g) yield lower probability (0.425), making the direct route optimal despite being "red."

## 4. Why This Plan is Optimal

- The selected paths maximize individual team success probabilities
- T1 uses the safer green corridors after the initial red segment
- T2 takes the calculated risk of the direct red route rather than multiple red segments
- Both teams carry maximum capacity (4 each = 8 total), providing a buffer above the 7 required

## 5. Probability of Success

Since both teams must succeed:
**P(success) = P(T1 succeeds) × P(T2 succeeds) = 0.4166 × 0.5 = 0.2083**

**The plan has a 20.83% probability of success.**

## 6. Step-by-Step Plan Description

**Step 1:** Team 1 at point a loads 2 resources

**Step 2:** Team 2 at point c loads 4 resources

**Step 3:** Team 1 travels from a to d via the red route (distance 5)

**Step 4:** Team 1 loads 2 additional resources at point d (now carrying 4 total)

**Step 5:** Team 2 travels directly from c to g via the red route (distance 6)

**Step 6:** Team 1 travels from d to e via the green route (distance 2)

**Step 7:** Team 1 continues from e to f via the green route (distance 4)

**Step 8:** Team 1 completes journey from f to g via the yellow route (distance 10)

**Step 9:** Both teams deliver their resources at g (4 + 4 = 8 resources delivered, exceeding the 7 required)

This plan represents the highest probability of success given the constraints. While 20.83% may seem low, it's the optimal solution given the high-risk red routes that cannot be entirely avoided and the requirement for both teams to succeed.
