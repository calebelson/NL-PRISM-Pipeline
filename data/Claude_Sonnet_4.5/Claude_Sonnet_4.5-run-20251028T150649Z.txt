I'll analyze this logistics problem systematically to find the optimal plan that maximizes the probability of delivering 7 resources to point g.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Available Resources:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources available**

**Demand:** 7 resources at point g

Since we have 8 resources available and need 7, the problem is **feasible** from a supply perspective.

## 2. Network Analysis

Let me map out the graph and identify possible routes:

**Starting Positions:**
- Team T1: at point a (near 2 resources)
- Team T2: at point c (where 4 resources are located)

**Routes to g:**
- From c: c→g (red, distance 6, probability 0.5)
- From a: Must go through b or d to eventually reach g
  - a→b→c→g: red(9) + red(4) + red(6) = red(19)
  - a→d→e→f→g: red(5) + green(2) + green(4) + yellow(10)

**Key Insight:** The direct route c→g is the most reliable single path to g with probability 0.5.

## 3. Optimal Strategy

Given that:
- We need 7 resources at g
- Each team can carry 4 resources
- We want to maximize probability

**Critical Analysis:**
- If we send resources in multiple trips, we multiply probabilities (reducing overall success)
- We should minimize the number of trips and use the safest routes
- Team T2 is already at c (where 4 resources are) with direct access to g

**Optimal Plan:**

**Team T2 (at c):**
- Load 4 resources from c
- Route: c→g (red, probability 0.5)

**Team T1 (at a):**
- Load 2 resources from a
- Pick up 2 resources from d
- Route to g: a→d→e→f→g
  - a→d: red, prob 0.5
  - d→e: green, prob 0.99
  - e→f: green, prob 0.99
  - f→g: yellow, prob 0.85
  - Combined probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4158

But wait - T1 needs to pick up resources at d. Let me reconsider:

**Revised Team T1 Plan:**
- **Trip 1:** Load 2 resources from a, travel a→d (red, 0.5), load 2 more resources at d, then continue d→e→f→g
- Route: a→d→e→f→g with probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = **0.4158**

**Team T2 Plan:**
- Load 4 resources from c
- Route: c→g with probability: **0.5**

## 4. Probability Calculation

For the plan to succeed, we need at least 7 resources to reach g:

**Scenario Analysis:**
- **Both teams succeed:** 4 + 4 = 8 resources delivered
  - Probability: 0.5 × 0.4158 = 0.2079
- **Only T2 succeeds:** 4 resources (FAILS - need 7)
- **Only T1 succeeds:** 4 resources (FAILS - need 7)
- **Both fail:** 0 resources (FAILS)

**Overall Success Probability: 0.2079 or approximately 20.79%**

## 5. Step-by-Step Plan

**Team T1:**
1. Start at point a
2. Load 2 resources from a
3. Travel a→d (red route, distance 5)
4. Load 2 additional resources from d (now carrying 4 total)
5. Travel d→e (green route, distance 2)
6. Travel e→f (green route, distance 4)
7. Travel f→g (yellow route, distance 10)
8. Deliver 4 resources to g

**Team T2:**
1. Start at point c
2. Load 4 resources from c
3. Travel c→g (red route, distance 6)
4. Deliver 4 resources to g

**Success Probability: 20.79%**

## 6. Why This Plan is Optimal

This plan is optimal because:
1. **Both teams must succeed** - We need 7 resources and each team carries 4, so we need at least one full delivery from each team
2. **T2's route is optimal** - The direct c→g path is the shortest and only viable route from c
3. **T1's route is optimal** - The a→d→e→f→g path uses the greenest (safest) routes possible while collecting all resources from a and d
4. **Alternative routes are worse** - Any path through b or f from a has lower probability due to longer red segments

The fundamental constraint is that we must have both teams succeed to meet the demand, which creates a multiplicative probability effect.
