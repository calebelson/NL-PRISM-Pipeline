I'll analyze this logistics optimization problem systematically.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Available Resources:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources**

**Demand:** Point g needs 7 resources

✅ **Feasible** - We have 8 resources available and need to deliver 7.

## 2. Network Analysis

Let me map out the routes with their safety probabilities:

**Routes (with success probabilities):**
- a-b: red, distance 9, p=0.5
- a-d: red, distance 5, p=0.5
- b-c: red, distance 4, p=0.5
- b-d: yellow, distance 12, p=0.85
- c-g: red, distance 6, p=0.5
- c-f: red, distance 12, p=0.5
- d-e: green, distance 2, p=0.99
- e-f: green, distance 4, p=0.99
- f-g: yellow, distance 10, p=0.85

**Key Observations:**
- T1 starts at **a** (has 2 resources)
- T2 starts at **c** (has 4 resources)
- Point **d** has 2 additional resources
- The safest path involves green routes (d-e-f) with p=0.99 each
- Direct route c-g is red (p=0.5) but short

## 3. Optimal Strategy

**Critical Insight:** We need 7 resources at g, and losing any team's cargo could make success impossible. Therefore, we should:
1. Maximize use of the safest (green) routes
2. Minimize the number of risky segments each critical shipment must traverse
3. Consider redundancy vs. concentrated risk

**Path Options to g:**
- **Path 1:** c → g (direct, 1 red segment, p=0.5)
- **Path 2:** d → e → f → g (2 green + 1 yellow, p=0.99×0.99×0.85=0.833)
- **Path 3:** a → d → e → f → g (1 red + 2 green + 1 yellow, p=0.5×0.99×0.99×0.85=0.416)

## 4. Optimal Plan

**Strategy:** Use the safest available routes and consolidate resources through the green corridor.

### Plan:

**Team 1 (starts at a with capacity 4):**
1. Pick up 2 resources at a
2. Travel a → d (red, p=0.5) and pick up 2 resources at d
3. Now carrying 4 resources total
4. Travel d → e → f → g (green-green-yellow)
   - d → e: p=0.99
   - e → f: p=0.99
   - f → g: p=0.85

**Team 2 (starts at c with capacity 4):**
1. Pick up 4 resources at c
2. Travel c → g (red, p=0.5) directly

**Alternative consideration:** Could T1 carry only from d via the safe route, but this requires coordination we should analyze.

## 5. Success Probability Calculation

Let me calculate probabilities for different scenarios:

**Scenario A (Proposed Plan):**
- T1 success: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.416 (delivers 4 resources)
- T2 success: 0.5 (delivers 4 resources)
- Need at least 7 resources total at g

Outcomes:
- Both succeed: 0.416 × 0.5 = 0.208 (8 resources delivered) ✓
- Only T1 succeeds: 0.416 × 0.5 = 0.208 (4 resources) ✗
- Only T2 succeeds: 0.584 × 0.5 = 0.292 (4 resources) ✗
- Both fail: 0.584 × 0.5 = 0.292 (0 resources) ✗

**Success probability: 20.8%** (only when both teams succeed)

**Scenario B (Both use safe route via d-e-f-g):**
- T1: Pick up at a (2), go a→d (p=0.5), pick up at d (2), carry 4 via d→e→f→g
  - Success: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.416
- T2: Go c→b→d (would need this route, but b-d is yellow p=0.85), or c→f→e→d (backwards, then forward)

Actually, T2 getting to the d-e-f corridor efficiently is problematic.

**Scenario C (T2 takes safe route, T1 supports):**
- T2: Travel c→f (red p=0.5), then stay or go c→g
  
Let me reconsider with T1 making multiple trips or T2 using safer routing.

**Better Plan - Scenario D:**

**Team 1:**
- Pick up 2 from a
- Travel a→d (p=0.5), pick up 2 from d (now carrying 4)
- Travel d→e→f→g (p=0.99×0.99×0.85)
- Total: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = **0.416**

**Team 2:**
- Pick up 4 from c  
- Travel c→f→g requires: c→f (red p=0.5) then f→g (yellow p=0.85)
- Total: 0.5 × 0.85 = **0.425**

But wait, c→f→g needs verification of path direction.

Given f-g is yellow (p=0.85) and undirected, this works.

**Revised calculation:**
- T1 delivers 4 with p=0.416
- T2 delivers 4 with p=0.425
- Both succeed: 0.416 × 0.425 = 0.177 (insufficient - only 17.7%)

The c→g direct route for T2 is actually better (p=0.5) than c→f→g (p=0.425).

## **FINAL OPTIMAL PLAN**

**Team 1 Route:** a → d → e → f → g
- Pick up 2 resources at a
- Travel to d (red, p=0.5), pick up 2 resources  
- Travel to e (green, p=0.99)
- Travel to f (green, p=0.99)
- Travel to g (yellow, p=0.85)
- **Carrying: 4 resources**
- **Success probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4162**

**Team 2 Route:** c → g
- Pick up 4 resources at c
- Travel directly to g (red, p=0.5)
- **Carrying: 4 resources**
- **Success probability: 0.5**

**Overall Success Probability:**
We need both teams to succeed (4+4=8, but need minimum 7):
- **Both succeed: 0.4162 × 0.5 = 0.2081 = 20.81%**

This is the probability that at least 7 resources reach g (in this case, all 8 resources arrive).

## 6. Step-by-Step Execution

**Team 1:**
1. Load 2 resources at point a
2. Depart a, travel to d via red route (distance 9→5, p=0.5)
3. Arrive at d, load 2 additional resources (total: 4)
4. Depart d, travel to e via green route (p=0.99)
5. Depart e, travel to f via green route (p=0.99)
6. Depart f, travel to g via yellow route (p=0.85)
7. Deliver 4 resources at g

**Team 2:**
1. Load 4 resources at point c
2. Depart c, travel directly to g via red route (p=0.5)
3. Deliver 4 resources at g

**Final Answer:** Maximum success probability is **20.81%** with both teams delivering their full cargo to point g.
