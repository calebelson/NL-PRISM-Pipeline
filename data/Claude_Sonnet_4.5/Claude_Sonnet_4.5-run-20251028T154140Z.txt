I'll analyze this logistics problem systematically to find the optimal routing and allocation plan.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Available Resources:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources**

**Demand:** Point g needs 7 resources

Since we have 8 available resources and need 7, the problem is **feasible** from a supply-demand perspective.

## 2. Network Analysis

Let me map out the network with safety probabilities:

**Routes and Safety:**
- a-b: red, distance 9, P = 0.5
- a-d: red, distance 5, P = 0.5
- b-c: red, distance 4, P = 0.5
- b-d: yellow, distance 12, P = 0.85
- c-g: red, distance 6, P = 0.5
- c-f: red, distance 12, P = 0.5
- d-e: green, distance 2, P = 0.99
- e-f: green, distance 4, P = 0.99
- f-g: yellow, distance 10, P = 0.85

**Team Locations:**
- T1 at point a (2 resources available locally)
- T2 at point c (4 resources available locally)

## 3. Path Analysis to Point g

**From c to g:**
- Direct: c-g (red, P = 0.5)
- Via f: c-f-g (red→yellow, P = 0.5 × 0.85 = 0.425)

**From a to g:**
- Via c: a-b-c-g (red→red→red, P = 0.5³ = 0.125)
- Via d-e-f: a-d-e-f-g (red→green→green→yellow, P = 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4157)

**From d to g:**
- Via e-f: d-e-f-g (green→green→yellow, P = 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.8326)

## 4. Optimal Strategy

The safest path is **d-e-f-g with probability 0.8326**. This uses only green and yellow routes.

**Key Insight:** We should concentrate resources at point d, then transport them via the safest route.

### Optimal Plan:

**Team 2 (starts at c with 4 resources available):**
- Pick up 4 resources at c
- Route: c → b → d (using c-b red P=0.5, then b-d yellow P=0.85)
- Combined probability: 0.5 × 0.85 = 0.425
- Then: d → e → f → g (green→green→yellow: 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.8326)
- **Total path probability: 0.425 × 0.8326 = 0.3539**

**Team 1 (starts at a with 2 resources available):**
- Pick up 2 resources at a
- Go to d: a → d (red, P = 0.5)
- Pick up 2 more resources at d (now carrying 4 total)
- Route: d → e → f → g (0.8326)
- **Total path probability: 0.5 × 0.8326 = 0.4163**

**Alternative consideration:** Could T1 make two trips? No - if T1 fails on first trip, we can't get 7 resources to g.

## 5. Success Probability Calculation

For the goal to be met (7 resources reach g), we need **at least one team to succeed** with enough resources:

- If only T2 succeeds: 4 resources (FAILS - need 7)
- If only T1 succeeds: 4 resources (FAILS - need 7)
- If both succeed: 8 resources (SUCCESS)

**Therefore, BOTH teams must succeed for the plan to work.**

**Overall Success Probability = P(T1 succeeds AND T2 succeeds)**
= 0.4163 × 0.3539 = **0.1474 or 14.74%**

## 6. Step-by-Step Plan

**Team 1:**
1. Start at point a
2. Pick up 2 resources at a
3. Travel a → d (red route, 5 distance)
4. Pick up 2 resources at d (now carrying 4 resources)
5. Travel d → e (green route, 2 distance)
6. Travel e → f (green route, 4 distance)
7. Travel f → g (yellow route, 10 distance)
8. Deliver 4 resources to g

**Team 2:**
1. Start at point c
2. Pick up 4 resources at c
3. Travel c → b (red route, 4 distance)
4. Travel b → d (yellow route, 12 distance)
5. Travel d → e (green route, 2 distance)
6. Travel e → f (green route, 4 distance)
7. Travel f → g (yellow route, 10 distance)
8. Deliver 4 resources to g

**Total delivered if both succeed: 8 resources (exceeds requirement of 7)**

## Conclusion

This plan maximizes reliability by:
- Using the safest available path (d-e-f-g) for the final approach
- Consolidating resources through point d
- Accepting that both teams must succeed (probability: **14.74%**)

The low success probability reflects the inherent risk in the network, particularly the red routes that must be traversed initially. No alternative routing strategy can improve this probability while meeting the 7-resource requirement.
