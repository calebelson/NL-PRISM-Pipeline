Looking at this logistics optimization problem, I need to analyze the available resources, routes, and safety probabilities to develop an optimal delivery plan.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Available Resources:**
- Location a: 2 resources (where T1 starts)
- Location c: 4 resources (where T2 starts)  
- Location d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources available**

**Requirement:** 7 resources needed at g

Since we have 8 resources available and need 7, the demand is theoretically feasible. However, we must verify that we can actually transport 7 resources to g given team capacity constraints (4 resources per team maximum) and route safety probabilities.

**Key constraint:** Each team can carry maximum 4 resources. To deliver 7 resources, we need at least two teams to succeed in reaching g, with combined loads of at least 7 resources.

## 2. Route Analysis

Let me identify the safest paths to g from each starting location:

**From a to g:**
- a→b→c→g: 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125
- **a→d→e→f→g: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.416** ✓ (best from a)

**From c to g:**
- **c→g: 0.5** ✓ (best from c)
- c→f→g: 0.5 × 0.85 = 0.425

**From d to g:**
- d→e→f→g: 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.833 (excellent, but no team starts here)

## 3. Optimal Plan

**Team 1 (T1) Route: a → d → e → f → g**
- Pick up 2 resources at a
- Travel to d (red route, prob 0.5)
- Pick up 2 additional resources at d (now carrying 4 total)
- Travel through e and f (green routes, combined 0.99 × 0.99 = 0.9801)
- Travel to g (yellow route, prob 0.85)
- **T1 success probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4165**
- **Delivers: 4 resources**

**Team 2 (T2) Route: c → g**
- Pick up 4 resources at c
- Travel directly to g (red route, prob 0.5)
- **T2 success probability: 0.5**
- **Delivers: 4 resources**

## 4. Success Analysis

For the mission to succeed, we need at least 7 resources at g, which requires both teams to succeed:

**Outcome Scenarios:**
1. ✓ Both teams succeed: 4 + 4 = 8 resources → **SUCCESS**
   - Probability: 0.4165 × 0.5 = **0.208**
   
2. ✗ Only T1 succeeds: 4 resources → FAILURE (insufficient)
   - Probability: 0.4165 × 0.5 = 0.208
   
3. ✗ Only T2 succeeds: 4 resources → FAILURE (insufficient)
   - Probability: 0.5835 × 0.5 = 0.292
   
4. ✗ Both teams fail: 0 resources → FAILURE
   - Probability: 0.5835 × 0.5 = 0.292

## 5. Success Probability

**The probability of mission success is 0.208 or 20.8%**

## 6. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

**Team 1:**
1. Load 2 resources at location a
2. Travel from a to d via red route (9 km equivalent)
3. Upon arrival at d, load 2 additional resources (total capacity: 4 resources)
4. Travel from d to e via green route (2 km)
5. Travel from e to f via green route (4 km)
6. Travel from f to g via yellow route (10 km)
7. Deliver 4 resources at g

**Team 2:**
1. Load 4 resources at location c
2. Travel from c to g via red route (6 km)
3. Deliver 4 resources at g

**Critical Success Condition:** Both teams must successfully complete their routes to deliver the required 7 resources (8 total delivered, exceeding the requirement by 1).

This plan maximizes reliability by:
- Using T1's path through the highly reliable green routes (d→e→f)
- Using T2's shortest available path from c
- Avoiding unnecessary route complexity
- Ensuring full utilization of both teams' carrying capacity (4 resources each)
