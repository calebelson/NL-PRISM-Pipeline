Looking at this logistics optimization problem, I need to analyze the resource distribution, routes, and safety probabilities systematically.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Resources Available:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources**

**Requirement:** 7 resources at point g

**Conclusion:** ✅ Feasible - we have sufficient resources (8 ≥ 7)

## 2. Route Analysis

Let me identify the safest routes to point g:

**From a to g (via d):**
- a → d → e → f → g
- Colors: red → green → green → yellow
- Probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = **0.4148** (best route from a)

**From c to g:**
- c → g (direct)
- Color: red
- Probability: **0.5** (best route from c)

**From d to g:**
- d → e → f → g  
- Colors: green → green → yellow
- Probability: 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = **0.833** (safest route overall)

## 3. Optimal Plan

Given that both teams can carry 4 resources and we need exactly 7, we must ensure both teams succeed (neither can individually carry 7, and if one fails with less than 7 resources total arriving, we fail).

**Team 1 (Starting at a):**
1. Load 2 resources at point a
2. Travel a → d (red route, probability 0.5)
3. Load 1 additional resource at point d (total carrying: 3)
4. Travel d → e → f → g (green-green-yellow routes)
5. **Route probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4148**
6. **Delivers: 3 resources**

**Team 2 (Starting at c):**
1. Load 4 resources at point c
2. Travel c → g (direct red route)
3. **Route probability: 0.5**
4. **Delivers: 4 resources**

## 4. Success Probability

Since we need both teams to succeed to deliver 7 resources:

**P(Success) = P(T1 succeeds) × P(T2 succeeds)**
**P(Success) = 0.4148 × 0.5 = 0.2074**

## 5. **Final Success Probability: 20.74%**

## 6. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

**Team 1:**
- Step 1: Load 2 resources at point a
- Step 2: Travel from a to d (5 units, red route)
- Step 3: Load 1 resource at point d (now carrying 3 total)
- Step 4: Travel from d to e (2 units, green route)
- Step 5: Travel from e to f (4 units, green route)  
- Step 6: Travel from f to g (10 units, yellow route)
- Step 7: Deliver 3 resources at point g

**Team 2:**
- Step 1: Load 4 resources at point c
- Step 2: Travel from c to g (6 units, red route)
- Step 3: Deliver 4 resources at point g

**Result:** If both teams succeed (20.74% probability), point g receives 3 + 4 = 7 resources as required.

---

**Why This Plan is Optimal:**

1. **Maximizes use of safest routes**: Team 1 uses the green-green-yellow path (d-e-f-g), which has the highest safety probability (0.833) for any route to g
2. **Minimizes exposure**: Team 2 takes the shortest route from c to g
3. **Balanced risk**: The combined probability of 20.74% is the highest achievable given that both teams must succeed to meet the 7-resource requirement
4. **No alternative delivers higher probability**: Any route that brings T2 through safer paths (like c→b→d→e→f→g) results in lower overall probability (~14.7%)
