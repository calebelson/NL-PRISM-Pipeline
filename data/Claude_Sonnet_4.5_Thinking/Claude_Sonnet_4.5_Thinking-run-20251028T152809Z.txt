Looking at this logistics optimization problem, I need to analyze the network, resource distribution, and safety probabilities to develop an optimal plan.

## 1. Feasibility Analysis

**Available Resources:**
- Point a: 2 resources
- Point c: 4 resources  
- Point d: 2 resources
- **Total: 8 resources available**

**Demand:** Point g needs 7 resources

**Capacity Constraint:** Each team can carry maximum 4 resources per trip

✅ **Feasible:** We have 8 resources available, which exceeds the requirement of 7.

## 2. Path Analysis

Let me identify the safest routes to point g:

**From point a (T1's location):**
- a→b→c→g: P = 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.125
- a→d→e→f→g: P = 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = **0.414** ✓ (best from a)

**From point c (T2's location):**
- c→g: P = **0.5** ✓ (best from c - direct route)
- c→f→g: P = 0.5 × 0.85 = 0.425 (actually worse due to compound probability)

## 3. Optimal Plan

Since each team can only carry 4 resources and we need 7 total, **both teams must successfully deliver** their resources. Therefore, we need to maximize: P(T1 succeeds) × P(T2 succeeds)

**Team 1 (T1) - Starting at point a:**
- Pick up 2 resources from a
- Travel a→d (red, P=0.5) and pick up 2 resources from d (now carrying 4)
- Continue d→e→f→g (green-green-yellow)
- Route probability: 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = **0.414**
- Delivers: 4 resources

**Team 2 (T2) - Starting at point c:**
- Pick up 4 resources from c
- Travel c→g (red, direct route)
- Route probability: **0.5**
- Delivers: 4 resources

## 4. Success Probability

**Overall Plan Success Probability: 0.414 × 0.5 = 0.207 = 20.7%**

Both teams must succeed since:
- Both succeed: 8 resources delivered ✓ (exceeds 7 needed)
- Only T1 succeeds: 4 resources ✗ (insufficient)
- Only T2 succeeds: 4 resources ✗ (insufficient)
- Both fail: 0 resources ✗ (complete failure)

## 5. Step-by-Step Execution Plan

**Team 1:**
1. Start at point a (load 2 resources)
2. Travel to point d via red edge (distance 9)
3. At point d, load 2 additional resources (total: 4 resources)
4. Travel to point e via green edge (distance 2)
5. Travel to point f via green edge (distance 4)
6. Travel to point g via yellow edge (distance 10)
7. Deliver 4 resources to point g

**Team 2:**
1. Start at point c (load 4 resources)
2. Travel directly to point g via red edge (distance 6)
3. Deliver 4 resources to point g

**Total if successful:** 8 resources delivered to point g (exceeding the 7 needed)

## Key Optimization Rationale

This plan maximizes reliability by:
1. **T1 uses the safest available path** (d→e→f→g segment has 83.3% success through green edges)
2. **T2 uses the shortest path** (minimizing exposure to single red edge)
3. **Efficient resource collection** (T1 consolidates resources from a and d; T2 takes all from c)
4. **No wasted capacity** (both teams carry 4 resources each)

The 20.7% success probability reflects the inherent risk of the red edges, which unfortunately cannot be avoided from either starting position.
