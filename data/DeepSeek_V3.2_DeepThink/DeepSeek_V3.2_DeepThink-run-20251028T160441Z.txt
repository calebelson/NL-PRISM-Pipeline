### Analysis and Plan for Resource Delivery to Point g

#### 1. Feasibility Assessment
The total available resources are 8 (2 at point a, 4 at point c, and 2 at point d), which exceeds the demand of 7 resources at point g. Therefore, it is feasible to satisfy the demand.

#### 2. Routing and Allocation Plan
To maximize the probability of successfully delivering at least 7 resources to point g, both teams should transport resources directly to g using the safest available paths. The plan involves:
- **Team 1 (T1)** at point a: Pick up the 2 resources from a, then proceed to point d to pick up the 2 resources from d, and finally deliver all 4 resources to g via the safest path.
- **Team 2 (T2)** at point c: Pick up the 4 resources from c and deliver them directly to g via the safest path.

This plan ensures that if both teams succeed, 8 resources reach g, satisfying the demand. The paths are chosen to optimize reliability, leveraging the highest safety probabilities where possible.

#### 3. Optimization for Reliability
The plan exclusively optimizes for reliability by:
- Using the safest paths for each team, minimizing the number of high-risk (red) segments where possible.
- For T1, using the green segments (d-e and e-f) and yellow segment (f-g) after the initial red segment (a-d), as this combination offers the highest probability of success from a to g.
- For T2, using the direct red segment (c-g) as it has a higher probability than any alternative route from c to g.

#### 4. Feasibility
The plan is feasible as both teams can carry 4 resources each, and the total resources available (8) are sufficient to meet the demand (7). The routes used are accessible and within the teams' carrying capacities.

#### 5. Probability of Success
The probability of success for the plan is the probability that both teams successfully reach g with their resources. This is calculated as follows:
- **T1's probability**: 
  - P(success from a to d) = 0.5 (red segment a-d)
  - P(success from d to g) = P(d-e) × P(e-f) × P(f-g) = 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.833085
  - Overall P(T1 success) = 0.5 × 0.833085 = 0.4165425
- **T2's probability**: 
  - P(success from c to g) = 0.5 (red segment c-g)
- **Overall probability**: P(both succeed) = P(T1 success) × P(T2 success) = 0.4165425 × 0.5 = 0.20827125 ≈ 0.2083

Thus, the probability of successfully delivering at least 7 resources to g is approximately 0.2083.

#### 6. Step-by-Step Plan Description
- **Team 1 (T1) at point a**:
  1. Pick up 2 resources from point a.
  2. Move from point a to point d via the red route (a-d) with safety probability 0.5.
  3. If successful, pick up 2 resources from point d. T1 now carries 4 resources.
  4. Move from point d to point e via the green route (d-e) with safety probability 0.99.
  5. If successful, move from point e to point f via the green route (e-f) with safety probability 0.99.
  6. If successful, move from point f to point g via the yellow route (f-g) with safety probability 0.85.
  7. If all steps are successful, deliver 4 resources to point g.

- **Team 2 (T2) at point c**:
  1. Pick up 4 resources from point c.
  2. Move directly from point c to point g via the red route (c-g) with safety probability 0.5.
  3. If successful, deliver 4 resources to point g.

- **Outcome**:
  - If both teams succeed, point g receives 8 resources, exceeding the demand of 7.
  - If either team fails, the resources carried by that team are lost, and the goal is not achieved since only 4 resources would be delivered at best.

This plan maximizes the probability of success by utilizing the safest possible routes for each team, given the constraints and available resources.
