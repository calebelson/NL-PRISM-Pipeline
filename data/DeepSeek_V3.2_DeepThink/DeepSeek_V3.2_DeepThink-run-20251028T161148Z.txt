### Analysis of Feasibility and Optimal Plan

The total resources available are 8 (2 at a, 4 at c, and 2 at d), which exceeds the demand of 7 at g. Therefore, it is feasible to satisfy the demand. The goal is to maximize the probability that g receives at least 7 resources, which requires both teams to succeed in delivering their resources, as each team carries 4 resources and 4 < 7. If either team fails, g receives at most 4 resources, which is insufficient.

### Optimal Routing and Allocation Plan
To maximize reliability, the plan minimizes the number of trips and uses the safest possible paths for each team. The optimal plan involves:
- Team 1 (T1) starting at a, picking up the 2 resources from a, then moving to d to pick up the 2 resources from d, and finally proceeding to g via the path a-d-e-f-g. This path has the highest probability for T1, as it avoids the riskier red routes where possible and uses greener routes for the latter segments.
- Team 2 (T2) starting at c, picking up the 4 resources from c, and moving directly to g via c-g. This path has the highest probability for T2, as alternative paths through other points have lower probabilities.

The probability of success for the plan is the product of the probabilities that both T1 and T2 reach g safely, calculated as follows:
- P(T1 success) = P(a-d) × P(d-e) × P(e-f) × P(f-g) = 0.5 × 0.99 × 0.99 × 0.85 = 0.4165425
- P(T2 success) = P(c-g) = 0.5
- P(overall success) = P(T1 success) × P(T2 success) = 0.4165425 × 0.5 = 0.20827125

Thus, the probability of success is approximately 0.2083.

### Step-by-Step Description of the Plan
1. **Team 1 (T1) at a**:
   - T1 picks up the 2 resources from a.
   - T1 moves from a to d via the direct route a-d (red, probability 0.5). If successful, T1 reaches d and picks up the 2 resources from d. T1 now carries 4 resources.
   - T1 moves from d to g via d-e-f-g (probability: d-e = 0.99, e-f = 0.99, f-g = 0.85). If successful, T1 delivers 4 resources to g.

2. **Team 2 (T2) at c**:
   - T2 picks up the 4 resources from c.
   - T2 moves from c to g via the direct route c-g (red, probability 0.5). If successful, T2 delivers 4 resources to g.

If both teams succeed, g receives 8 resources, which satisfies the demand of 7. If either team fails, the plan fails, and g receives insufficient resources.

This plan optimizes reliability by using the safest available paths for each team, considering the constraints on resource allocation and routing.
