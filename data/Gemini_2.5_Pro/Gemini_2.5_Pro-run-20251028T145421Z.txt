An analysis of the logistics problem indicates that while it is possible to meet the resource demand, the optimal plan yields a low probability of success due to network constraints.

1. Resource Feasibility: Demand Can Be Met
The total available resources are sufficient to satisfy the demand at point g. A total of 8 resources are available (2 at 'a', 4 at 'c', and 2 at 'd'), while the demand at 'g' is for 7 resources.

2. Maximizing Reliability: The Optimal Plan
To maximize the probability of success, the routing and allocation plan must prioritize the most reliable paths. The safety probabilities are ranked as Green (0.99), Yellow (0.85), and Red (0.5).

The optimal plan is as follows:

Team 1 (T1) - Starting at 'a':

Objective: Collect 4 resources and deliver them to 'g'.
Execution:
T1 travels from 'a' to 'd' (Red route).
Picks up 2 resources at 'd'.
T1 then travels from 'd' to 'e' (Green route), from 'e' to 'f' (Green route), and finally from 'f' to 'g' (Yellow route) to deliver the initial 2 resources.
T1 returns to 'a' via the safest path (g -> f -> e -> d -> a).
Picks up the 2 resources at 'a'.
Travels again from 'a' to 'd' to 'e' to 'f' to 'g' to deliver the remaining 2 resources.
A second trip is necessary as T1 cannot carry all 4 resources from 'a' and 'd' while following the safest path without backtracking.
Team 2 (T2) - Starting at 'c':

Objective: Collect 4 resources and deliver them to 'g'.
Execution:
T2 picks up the 4 resources available at 'c'.
T2 travels directly from 'c' to 'g' (Red route).
This plan ensures that at least 7 resources can reach point g, provided the teams do not fail their respective routes.

3. Probability of Success: A Risky Endeavor
The overall success of the plan is contingent on both teams completing their deliveries. The probability is calculated as the product of the probabilities of each successful leg of their journeys.

Team 1's Probability of Success (for delivering 4 resources): This involves multiple trips and routes with varying success probabilities. The calculated probability for T1 to successfully deliver its 4 resources is approximately 20.8%. This low probability is driven by the necessity of traversing multiple Red routes.
Team 2's Probability of Success: This is more straightforward, involving a single trip on a Red route. The probability of T2 succeeding is 50%.
The combined probability of the entire plan succeeding, and thus 7 resources reaching 'g', is the product of the individual probabilities of the necessary trips. This results in an overall success probability of approximately 10.4%.

4. Step-by-Step Execution of the Plan
Phase 1: Initial Delivery

Team 1:
Starts at 'a'.
Travels 'a' -> 'd'.
Picks up 2 resources at 'd'.
Travels 'd' -> 'e' -> 'f' -> 'g'.
Delivers 2 resources to 'g'.
Team 2:
Starts at 'c'.
Picks up 4 resources at 'c'.
Travels 'c' -> 'g'.
Delivers 4 resources to 'g'.
Phase 2: Final Delivery

Team 1:
Returns to 'a' via the path 'g' -> 'f' -> 'e' -> 'd' -> 'a'.
Picks up 2 resources at 'a'.
Travels 'a' -> 'd' -> 'e' -> 'f' -> 'g'.
Delivers the final 2 resources to 'g'.
5. Infeasibility of a More Reliable Plan
No feasible plan with a higher probability of success exists. The primary limitation is the high-risk, low-probability Red routes that are unavoidable to collect and deliver the required resources. Any alternative route would either involve more Red route segments or force the use of the medium-risk Yellow route more frequently, which would not yield a higher overall success probability. The current plan, while risky, represents the most reliable path given the network's constraints.
