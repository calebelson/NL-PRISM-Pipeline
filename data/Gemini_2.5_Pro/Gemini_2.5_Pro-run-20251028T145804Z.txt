Answering the complex logistical challenge of supplying point 'g' with 7 resources requires a methodical approach that prioritizes the probability of success. Here is a detailed analysis and the optimal plan:

1. Feasibility of Meeting Demand
The initial step is to determine if the available resources are sufficient to meet the demand at point 'g'.

Available Resources:
Point a: 2 resources
Point c: 4 resources
Point d: 2 resources
Total Available: 2 + 4 + 2 = 8 resources
Demand:
Point g: 7 resources
Conclusion: With 8 available resources and a demand for 7, the mission is feasible.

2. The Optimal Routing and Allocation Plan
To maximize the probability of success, each team must travel along the most reliable routes. The overall success of the plan is contingent on both teams successfully completing their respective journeys.

Team 1 (T1):

Starting Point: a
Initial Resources: 2
Route and Action:
Travel from a to d. This is a 'red' route with a safety probability of 0.5.
At point d, pick up the 2 available resources. T1 now carries its maximum capacity of 4 resources.
Travel from d to e ('green' route, probability 0.99), then e to f ('green' route, probability 0.99), and finally f to g ('yellow' route, probability 0.85).
Team 2 (T2):

Starting Point: c
Initial Resources: 4
Route and Action:
At point c, pick up the 4 available resources.
Travel directly from c to g. This is a 'red' route with a safety probability of 0.5.
This plan ensures that 4 resources from T1 and 4 resources from T2 are dispatched, totaling 8 resources, which satisfies the demand of 7 at point 'g'.

3. Optimization for Reliability
The core of this plan is to select the paths with the highest cumulative probability of success for each team.

Team 1's Path Probability: The probability of T1 successfully completing its journey is the product of the probabilities of each leg of its route:
P(T1) = P(a→d) * P(d→e) * P(e→f) * P(f→g)
P(T1) = 0.5 * 0.99 * 0.99 * 0.85
P(T1) = 0.4167
Team 2's Path Probability: The probability of T2's success is the probability of its single-leg journey:
P(T2) = P(c→g)
P(T2) = 0.5
Any alternative routes would involve more 'red' links or longer paths, which would decrease the overall probability of success for either team. For instance, the route for T1 from a-b-c-g has a much lower probability (0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125).

4. Probability of Success for the Plan
The overall plan is successful only if both Team 1 and Team 2 complete their deliveries. Therefore, the total probability of success is the product of their individual probabilities.

Total Probability of Success = P(T1 Success) * P(T2 Success)
Total Probability of Success = 0.4167 * 0.5
Total Probability of Success = 0.2084 or 20.84%
5. Step-by-Step Description of the Plan
Team 2 Mobilization: Team 2, located at point c, loads the 4 available resources.
Team 2 Departure: Team 2 departs from c and travels directly to g.
Team 1 Mobilization: Simultaneously, Team 1 at point a loads the 2 available resources.
Team 1 Resource Collection: Team 1 travels from a to d. Upon arrival, it collects the 2 resources at d.
Team 1 Departure to Destination: With a full load of 4 resources, Team 1 travels from d to e, then to f, and finally to the destination g.
Mission Completion: The arrival of both teams at g results in the delivery of a total of 8 resources, successfully meeting the demand.
