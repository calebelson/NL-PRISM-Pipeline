1. Feasibility of Meeting Demand
A thorough assessment of the available resources against the demand confirms the feasibility of the operation.

Total Available Resources: There are 2 resources at point 'a', 4 at point 'c', and 2 at point 'd', making a total of 8 resources.
Demand: Point 'g' requires 7 resources.
Team Capacity: The two teams, T1 and T2, have a combined carrying capacity of 8 (4 each), which is sufficient to transport the required resources.
Given that the resource availability (8) exceeds the demand (7), the mission is feasible.

2. Optimal Routing and Allocation Plan
To maximize the probability of success, the following plan leverages the safest available routes for each team's necessary journey. The core of this strategy is to assign routes that have the highest cumulative safety probability.

Resource Allocation:

Team 2 (T2): Will transport 4 resources.
Team 1 (T1): Will transport the remaining 3 resources.
Routing Plan:

T2: Starts at 'c' and picks up all 4 resources. It will then travel the most direct and safest route to the destination: c → g.
T1: Starts at 'a' and picks up the 2 available resources. To acquire the third resource, T1 must travel to 'd'. Thus, its initial leg is a → d. At 'd', it picks up 1 resource. Now carrying 3 resources, T1 will proceed along the safest path from 'd' to 'g', which is d → e → f → g.
3. Maximizing Reliability
The chosen plan is optimized for reliability by breaking down the problem into the necessary paths for each team and selecting the route with the highest probability of success for each.

For T2: The journey from 'c' to 'g' has two primary paths:
c → g (Red): Probability = 0.5
c → f → g (Red, Yellow): Probability = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425
The direct route c → g is the most reliable option for T2.
For T1: The team must travel from 'a' to 'g' with an intermediate stop at 'd'. The overall path is a → d → g.
The initial, unavoidable leg is a → d (Red) with a safety probability of 0.5.
From 'd', the safest path to 'g' is d → e → f → g (Green, Green, Yellow), with a combined probability of 0.99 * 0.99 * 0.85 = 0.8333.
Any other route from 'd' to 'g' would be less reliable.
Therefore, T1's total path probability is the product of its legs: 0.5 * 0.8333 = 0.4167.
The overall success of the plan depends on both teams completing their journeys independently.

4. Feasibility Explanation
As established in the initial assessment, a feasible plan exists because the total available resources (8) are sufficient to meet the demand at point 'g' (7).

5. Probability of Success
The total probability of the plan's success is the product of the individual probabilities of each team successfully completing its assigned route.

Probability of T1 Success: P(a→d) * P(d→e) * P(e→f) * P(f→g) = 0.5 * 0.99 * 0.99 * 0.85 = 0.4167
Probability of T2 Success: P(c→g) = 0.5
Total Plan Success Probability: P(T1 Success) * P(T2 Success) = 0.4167 * 0.5 = 0.2084
Therefore, the likelihood of successfully delivering all 7 resources to point 'g' is 20.84%.

6. Step-by-Step Plan Description
The execution of the mission is broken down into the following sequential steps:

Team 2 - Resource Collection: Team 2, positioned at point 'c', loads the 4 available resources.
Team 1 - Initial Loading: Simultaneously, Team 1 at point 'a' loads the 2 resources available at its location.
Team 1 - Resource Consolidation: Team 1 travels from 'a' to 'd' via the red route. Upon arrival, it collects 1 additional resource, bringing its total cargo to 3.
Team 2 - Delivery Route: Team 2 proceeds directly from 'c' to 'g' along the red route to deliver its 4 resources.
Team 1 - Delivery Route: After securing its third resource, Team 1 travels from 'd' to 'g' following the high-reliability path: d → e (green), e → f (green), and f → g (yellow).
Mission Completion: The successful arrival of both teams at point 'g' results in the delivery of the required 7 resources.
