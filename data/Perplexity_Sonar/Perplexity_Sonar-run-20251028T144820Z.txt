Supply Feasibility

There are 8 total resources available (2 at a, 4 at c, and 2 at d), which is enough to meet the demand of g needing 7 resources—the supply is feasible.

Best Reliability Paths for Supply Delivery
The goal is to maximize the probability that resources reach g. Failure of a single team (with loss of up to 4 resources) means the plan fails if the remaining resources are insufficient. Here is the optimal routing strategy based on maximizing route reliability (not distance or speed):

From a to g: The highest reliability path is a → d → e → f → g (colors: red, green, green, yellow), with a per-team success probability of about 0.4165.

From c to g: The only direct path is c → g (color: red), with a per-team success probability of 0.5.

From d to g: The highest reliability path is d → e → f → g (colors: green, green, yellow), with a per-team success probability of 0.8331.

Resource Allocation and Team Routing
Team 1 (T1) starts at a, Team 2 (T2) at c. Each team can carry up to 4 resources per trip. The available resources are 2 at a, 4 at c, and 2 at d.

T1 (at a):
First trip: Pick up 2 from a, go to d (distance 5, red: 0.5), pick up 2 more from d, and proceed to e (green: 0.99), f (green: 0.99), and finally g (yellow: 0.85).

0.5×0.99×0.99×0.85=0.4165.
Resources delivered per trip: 4.

T2 (at c):
First trip: Pick up 4 from c, go directly to g (distance 6, red: 0.5).
Success probability per trip: 0.5.
Resources delivered per trip: 4.

Alternative: Collecting from d

T2 (at c):
Could theoretically go c → d → e → f → g (colors: yellow, green, green, yellow), but this route requires traversing c → d (yellow, 0.85), then d → e → f → g (green, green, yellow: 0.8331).

0.7082
0.85×0.8331=0.7082.
Resources delivered: Would pick up 2 from d, so this is not efficient to meet demand (only 6 resources total delivered if both teams succeed, missing demand of 7).

T1 (at a):
Could go a → d (red, 0.5), pick up 2, and d → g (green, green, yellow, 0.83).
But then T2 must deliver everything at c (4) directly, and T1 can deliver only 2 from d (total = 6; insufficient).

Optimal Plan
To maximize both delivery sufficiency and reliability, the best plan is:

T2 (at c) makes a direct delivery to g with 4 resources, probability 0.5 per trip.

T1 (at a) picks up 2 from a, goes to d, picks up 2 more, and proceeds (d → e → f → g) with 4 resources, probability 0.4165 per trip.

If either team fails, at most 4 resources are lost, making it impossible to meet the demand of 7 with the remaining 4 resources.
Both teams must succeed for the goal to be reached.

Probability of Success
Since both teams must succeed for a total of 8 resources to reach g (the demand is 7):

P(success)=P(T1 succeeds)×P(T2 succeeds)=0.4165×0.5=0.2083
Overall probability of delivering at least 7 resources to g: 20.83%.

Step-by-Step Plan
Team 1 (T1):

Load: 2 resources from a.

Travel: a → d (red, 0.5).

Load: 2 more resources from d.

Travel: d → e (green, 0.99), e → f (green, 0.99), f → g (yellow, 0.85).

Unload: 4 resources at g.

Team 2 (T2):

Load: 4 resources from c.

Travel: c → g (red, 0.5).

Unload: 4 resources at g.

Outcome
If both teams succeed: 8 resources reach g (surplus of 1).

If either team fails: Only 4 resources reach g (insufficient).

Summary Table
Team	Route	Resources Carried	Per-trip Success Probability	Needed for Demand?
T1	a → d → e → f → g	4	0.4165	Yes
T2	c → g	4	0.5	Yes
Only if both T1 and T2 succeed is the demand met—probability of both succeeding: 20.83%.
If either fails, the plan fails to meet demand, and all carried resources are lost.
No higher-reliability routing exists that also satisfies the demand constraint.

Conclusion
Feasibility: The supply is sufficient to meet the demand at g.

Optimal Plan:

T1: a → d → e → f → g (carry 4, P = 0.4165).

T2: c → g (carry 4, P = 0.5).

Both must succeed.

Probability: Overall plan success is 20.83%.

Explanation: Any other routing would either not deliver enough resources or have equal/lower reliability. No single path from a or c to g offers higher combined reliability and resource delivery. Multi-hop paths increase reliability but do not deliver enough resources in a single trip.

If teams could split or make multiple trips, higher success probabilities might be possible, but with only two teams and one possible delivery each, the above is optimal within the constraints.
