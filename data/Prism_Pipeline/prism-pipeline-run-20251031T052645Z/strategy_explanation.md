## Overview
Total steps: 25 (24 actions followed by the final goal state). Final success probability: 2.0478% (path probability = 0.020478). Key challenge: multiple traversals over lower-safety (red, 50%) and several back-and-forth moves increase the chance of failure despite many high-safety (99%) intra-leg transfers.
