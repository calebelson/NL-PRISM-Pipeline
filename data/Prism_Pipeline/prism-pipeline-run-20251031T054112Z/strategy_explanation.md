## Overview
Total steps: 25 (24 actions executed).  
Final success probability: 2.0478% (path probability 0.020478).  
Key challenge: multiple risky traversals (many small-failure-risk 99% legs and several 50% legs) and repeated back-and-forth shuttling to accumulate the 7 units at g.

## Final State
- Team 1 ends at: g  
- Team 2 ends at: f  
- Resources by node:
  - a: 0
  - b: 0
  - c: 0
  - d: 0
  - e: 0
  - f: 1
  - g: 7

Summary: The strategy concentrates deliveries at g to meet the demand of 7 units (final xg = 7) with team1 finishing at g and team2 at f; the overall probability that this entire action sequence succeeds is ~2.0478%.
